      <li>I wrote my first "Hello World" program at age nineteen (19).</li>

        My favorite programming joke: "Why do programmers prefer dark mode?
        Because light attracts bugs!"

      <li>
        My dream is to contribute to an open-source project that helps millions
        of people.
      </li>
      <li>
        I once stayed up all night debugging a single semicolon error (and I
